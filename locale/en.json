    "policy_analysis_paragraph_3": "Producer support measures, if they meet their objective of encouraging production, can increase the supply of rice in the medium term, benefiting input suppliers through greater demand for them. For its part, direct purchases by governments generated an immediate benefit for rice producers and industries in some countries. Likewise, consumer support measures can boost demand.",
    "policy_analysis_paragraph_4": "Regarding foreign trade policies, the impact varies depending on the context and perspective. The approval of new import quotas can benefit the consumer by increasing supply and reducing prices, but at the same time it represents a risk for producers when they are able to satisfy that supply. This policy could also affect the competitiveness of other countries in the region, under a scenario in which rice imported with tariff preferences is exported to other countries. On the other hand, policies focused on import restriction could increase prices in national markets, affecting consumers and regional exporters, in favor of local producers.",
    "policy_analysis_paragraph_5": "Regarding exports, favoring exports could affect local supply; however, at a regional level, exporters such as Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay and Guyana manage to supply local demand without problems. In Ecuador, the local market was prioritized over exports, due to an increase in prices at the national level. In contrast, the restriction on exports could reduce the price in the national market or increase the price in the international market, either depending on supply and demand in the national market or the magnitude that the country represents in the exportable supply to global or regional level.",

In the first forum, the results of a participatory diagnosis with key actors in the sector at the regional level were presented, providing a preamble for discussion for a second forum, where three panelists analyzed the situation and presented possible scenarios and alternatives for the sector on nutrition issues. and markets.
